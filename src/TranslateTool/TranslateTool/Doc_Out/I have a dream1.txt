Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of bad captivity.
译：五年前，一位伟大的美国人签署了解放宣言，我们今天站在他象征性的阴影下。这一重大法令的颁布，对无数被奴颜婢膝的黑人奴隶带来了希望的灯塔。它的到来犹如欢乐的黎明，结束了囚禁的漫漫长夜。
    But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
译：但是一百年后，黑人仍然不是自由的。一百年后，黑人的生活仍然被种族隔离的镣铐和歧视的链条所折磨。一百年后，黑人生活在一个贫穷的孤岛上，在物质繁荣的汪洋大海中。一百年后，黑人仍然在美国社会的角落里憔悴，并发现自己在自己的土地上流放。今天我们来到这里是为了戏剧性地描述一个可耻的情况。
    I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
译：我并不是没有意识到你们中的一些人是从巨大的考验和磨难中来到这里的。你们中的一些人刚从狭小的牢房里出来。你们中的一些人来自于你们追求自由的领域，你们被迫害的风暴击溃，并被警察暴行的狂风所震撼。你一直是创造苦难的退伍军人。继续工作，相信不劳而获的痛苦是救赎的。
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.
译：回到密西西比州，回到亚拉巴马州，回到南卡罗来纳州，回到格鲁吉亚，回到路易斯安那，回到我们北方城市的贫民窟和贫民窟，知道这种情况能够而且将会改变。让我们不要陷入绝望的深渊。
I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
译：朋友们，今天我对你们说，即使我们面对今天和明天的困难，我仍然有一个梦想。这是一个深深扎根于美国梦中的梦。
    I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live up to the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.”
译：我梦想有一天，这个国家将奋起，实现其信条的真谛：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的，人人生而平等。”

    I have a dream today.
译：我今天有一个梦想。
    I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.
译：我梦想有一天，每一个山谷都将被高举，每一座山丘和山峰都将被夷为平地，崎岖不平的地方将变得平坦，弯曲的地方将变得笔直，上帝的荣耀将显露出来，所有的肉身都将一起看到它。
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
译：这是我们的希望。这是我带回South的信念。有了这个信念，我们就能从绝望的山峰中砍出一块希望之石。有了这个信念，我们就能够把我们国家的嘈杂争吵转变成一种美丽的兄弟情谊交响乐。有了这个信念，我们就能一起工作，一起祈祷，一起奋斗，一起坐牢，一起为自由站起来，因为我们知道有一天我们会自由。
    This will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning.
