? Wait 60 seconds for the firmware to detect the loopback and reset the pingStation to DHCP mode.
? Remove power.
? Remove the JST loopback connector and attach it back onto the inside of the front plate like it was originally.
? Reapply power and verify with the DHCP server that it has issued an address to this pingStation.
? Reassemble the pingStation in the reverse order.
